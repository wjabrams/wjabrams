- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wjabrams
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Audible and other audio books, capturing audio from lectures and converting to MP3's, converting all my CD's and cassette tapes to MP3's,
and putting it all on ipods with RockBox.  My latest projects are 2 TB to 4 TB ipods using RockBox and learning the most awesome AAX Audio Converter.
